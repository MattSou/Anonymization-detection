### Alpha mapping
Based on [PyMatting: A Python Library for Alpha Matting](https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.02481), see the [Pymatting GitHub repo](https://github.com/pymatting/pymatting/tree/master). 

## Blur detection
The notebook and the python file use SVD decomposition to get blur maps of images. Based on the [CUHK motion/out of focus blur dataset](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~leojia/projects/dblurdetect/dataset.html).

## Blur_features
Early experiments in `Blur_features.ipynb` and `Blur_spectrum` on gradient and spectrum as tools to compute blur features.
